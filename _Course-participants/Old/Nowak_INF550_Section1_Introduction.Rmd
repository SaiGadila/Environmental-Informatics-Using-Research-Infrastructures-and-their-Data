**Introduction**

Hello Hello. My name is Scooter Nowak. I'm a second year Ecoinformatics PhD student at NAU in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Cyber Systems (SICCS). I have a BS in Computer Science (MTU), a BS in Fisheries and Wildlife (MSU), and a MS in Aquatic Entomology (MSU). I spent 25+ years in IT with almost 20 of those years working for the Federal Government in the intelligence community. I'm very excited about this program!
