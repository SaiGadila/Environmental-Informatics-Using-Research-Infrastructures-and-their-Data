Hi everyone, my name is Ben Wiebe and I am a first-year Ecological Informatics PhD student in the T3 program in SICCS. I did my undergrad in ecology at Goshen College, and am now doing research in Chris Doughty's lab related to remote sensing techniques of tree water stress and related ecophysiological processes. I look forward to learning with you all.
