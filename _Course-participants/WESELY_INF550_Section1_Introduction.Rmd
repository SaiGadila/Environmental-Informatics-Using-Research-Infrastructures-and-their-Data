### Introduction

Hello, I'm Natasha Wesely. I am a second year PhD student, co-advised by Dr. Andrew Richardson and Dr. David Auty. I am working on modeling carbon cycle impacts of precipitation variability in four different ecosystem types in New Mexico. However the model I am building on is written in fortran... wish me luck!
